<h1 align="Center">Types of ship</h1>
<h2>1.Container Ship<h2>
<img src="C:\Users\jnach\OneDrive\Pictures\ship1.png" width="650px" height="550px">
<p>A container ship is a cargo ship that carries all of its load in truck-size intermodal containers, in a technique called containerization. Container ships are a common means of commercial intermodal freight transport and now carry most seagoing non-bulk cargo. </p>

<h2>2.Bulk Carrier Ship<h2>
<img src="C:\Users\jnach\OneDrive\Pictures\ship2.png" width="650px" height="550px">
<p>A bulk carrier or bulker is a merchant ship specially designed to transport unpackaged bulk cargo — such as grains, coal, ore, steel coils, and cement — in its cargo holds. </p>

<h2>3.Tanker Ships<h2>
<img src="C:\Users\jnach\OneDrive\Pictures\ship8.png" width="650px" height="550px">
<p>A tanker is a ship designed to transport or store liquids or gases in bulk. Major types of tankship include the oil tanker, the chemical tanker, and gas carrier. Tankers also carry commodities such as vegetable oils, molasses and wine.</p>

<h2>4.Passenger Ships<h2>
<img src="C:\Users\jnach\OneDrive\Pictures\ship.png" width="650px" height="550px">
<p>A passenger ship is a merchant ship whose primary function is to carry passengers on the sea. The category does not include cargo vessels which have accommodations for limited numbers of passengers, such as the ubiquitous twelve-passenger freighters once common on the seas in which the transport of passengers is secondary to the carriage of freight. The type does however include many classes of ships designed to transport substantial numbers of passengers as well as freight. Indeed, until recently virtually all ocean liners were able to transport mail, package freight and express, and other cargo in addition to passenger luggage, and were equipped with cargo holds and derricks, kingposts, or other cargo-handling gear for that purpose. Only in more recent ocean liners and in virtually all cruise ships has this cargo capacity been eliminated.</p>

<h2>5.Naval Ships<h2>
<img src="C:\Users\jnach\OneDrive\Pictures\ship5.png" width="650px" height="550px">
<p> A naval ship is a military ship (or sometimes boat, depending on classification) used by a navy. Naval ships are differentiated from civilian ships by construction and purpose. Generally, naval ships are damage resilient and armed with weapon systems, though armament on troop transports is light or non-existent.

Naval ships designed primarily for naval warfare are termed warships, as opposed to support (auxiliary ships) or shipyard operations.</p>

<h2>6.Special Purpose Vessel<h2>
<img src="C:\Users\jnach\OneDrive\Pictures\ship6.png" width="650px" height="550px">
<p>Special purpose vessel means a mechanically self-propelled vessel which by reason of its function carries on board more than 12 special personnel including passengers. Special purpose vessels include oceanographic research vessels and nautical school vessels.</p>

<h2>7.Off-shore Ship</h2>
<img src="C:\Users\jnach\OneDrive\Pictures\ship9.png" width="650px" height="550px">
<p style="font:320%;"><b>Offshore vessels are ships that specifically serve operational purposes such as oil exploration and construction work at the high seas.</b></p>
